# CircuitPythonProjects

This Python script uses PySpice to simulate circuits powered by Ngspice. It imports libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib, sets up voltage divider and diode circuits, defines custom subcircuits, and conducts DC sweep analysis. The script then simulates each circuit using the defined simulator and prints the results.

# About

This Python script is a Python script for circuit simulation using PySpice, a package for simulating electronic circuits powered by Ngspice. It imports libraries like NumPy for numerical computations, Matplotlib for plotting, and PySpice for circuit simulation. The script sets up a simple voltage divider circuit with two resistors, a diode circuit with a voltage source, resistors, and diode component, a custom subcircuit with a resistor and diode, and a DC sweep circuit for DC sweep analysis. The script then simulates each circuit using the defined simulator and prints the results.
